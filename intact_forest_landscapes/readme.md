### Intact Forest Landscapes

With these notebook, we can reproduce intact forest data as binary system. Pixel values are going to be 1 or 0. For this process, 
firstly, we create 512*512 tile from raw data, then we get data that over land area.(delete files that over sea) Then we change nodata value(-32768) to 0


The Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers.
