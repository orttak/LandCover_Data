### Relative Magnitude of Fragmentation (RMF) data preparation

"Global remote-sensing data product (i.e. the 27-year annual ESA CCI land cover maps which can be categorized as an EBV ‘Ecosystem Distribution’) to derive an annual (27 year) time-series of the Relative Magnitude of Fragmentation (RMF) at a global scale and with a spatial resolution of 300m. From this derived EBV data product, we can calculate a RMF indicator of ecosystem degradation, i.e. the change, and rate of change, in fragmentation of ecosystems (e.g. forests) over the last 27 years."

You can convert .nc format data to annual tif data with this notebook.
